## Project Overview
This project defines a personal website for Chitransh Jaiswal using HTML. The head element incorporates a section of metadata, including authorship, keywords, and a summary of the website. The main part of the webpage includes content blocks dedicated to the author’s profile, education, hobbies, provided licenses and certificates, and skills.

A number of pictures, tables, and lists have been used on the website to present the content in the most efficient arrangement. Each certification credential comes with hyperlinks, allowing readers to link to the sites where the author attained the credentials. The use of header, main, and footer elements structures the webpage.

The footer consists of a hard return and a hypertext link leading to a “Contact me” page. This document serves as a professional curriculum vitae, indicating the level of education, certifications, skills, and contact information.
